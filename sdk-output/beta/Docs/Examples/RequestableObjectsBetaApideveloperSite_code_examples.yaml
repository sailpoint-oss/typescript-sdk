        $identityId =  # string | If present, the value returns only requestable objects for the specified identity.  * Admin users can call this with any identity ID value.  * Non-admin users can only specify *me* or pass their own identity ID value.  * If absent, returns a list of all requestable objects for the tenant. Only admin users can make such a call. In this case, the available, pending, assigned accesses will not be annotated in the result. (optional) (default to undefined)
        $types =  # Array<RequestableObjectTypeBeta> | Filters the results to the specified type/types, where each type is one of ROLE or ACCESS_PROFILE. If absent, all types are returned. Support for additional types may be added in the future without notice. (optional) (default to undefined)
        
        $types = @"ROLE,ACCESS_PROFILE"@
        $term =  # string | It allows searching requestable access items with a partial match on the name or description. If term is provided, then the *filter* query parameter will be ignored. (optional) (default to undefined)
        $statuses =  # Array<RequestableObjectRequestStatusBeta> | Filters the result to the specified status/statuses, where each status is one of AVAILABLE, ASSIGNED, or PENDING. It is an error to specify this parameter without also specifying an *identity-id* parameter. Additional statuses may be added in the future without notice. (optional) (default to undefined)
        
        $statuses = @"[ASSIGNED, PENDING]"@
        $limit =  # number | Max number of results to return. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information. (optional) (default to 250)
        $offset =  # number | Offset into the full result set. Usually specified with *limit* to paginate through the results. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information. (optional) (default to 0)
        $count =  # boolean | If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.  Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.  See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information. (optional) (default to false)
        $filters =  # string | Filter results using the standard syntax described in [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#filtering-results)  Filtering is supported for the following fields and operators:  **id**: *eq, in*  **name**: *eq, in, sw*  (optional) (default to undefined)
        $sorters =  # string | Sort results using the standard syntax described in [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#sorting-results)  Sorting is supported for the following fields: **name**  (optional) (default to undefined)
