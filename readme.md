This repository contains the complete build, with assets, for the SailPoint TypeScript SDK. 
The TypeScript SDK allows you to use TypeScript to interact with the SailPoint APIs and other resources to customize and extend your SailPoint platform. 

## Documentation 

To get started with the TypeScript SDK and learn about its various functionalities, refer to the [documentation](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/tools/sdk/typescript) on https://developer.sailpoint.com. 

## Examples

In addition to the examples shown in the [documentation](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/tools/sdk/typescript), you can find more uses of the TypeScript SDK in the [examples](./examples/src/index.ts).

## Contributing 

The SailPoint Developer Relations Team is always actively working to improve the SailPoint TypeScript SDK to make it as useful as possible to the SailPoint Developer Community. 
This means adding and maintaining new resources and functionalities for the SDK.
The most valuable resource of all, however, is the community itself! 
We greatly appreciate any input, feedback, and direct contributions you can provide to the TypeScript SDK, big or small.
